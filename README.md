# [Gataguy.pl](http://dataguy.pl/) - first steps in Django

Since I like to learn new things and want to have my own website - some day
I will work as a freelancer - I decided to play with Django framework. 

Besides Django I wanted to get familiar with nginx and docker, so the final
result is a working web page with nginx as a server and it is all in docker
container.

###### Makefile main commands
- up-prod - build and initialize website
- up-dev - for development
- migrate - for model schemas changes
- staticfiles - to django's collect static files

The whole thing is live thanks to https://www.pythonanywhere.com/
